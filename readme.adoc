== Quarkus Camel extension demo

This Demo demonstrates how to execute Drools Rules from within a Camel Route:

----
from("direct:start").setBody().simple("Hello World Camel fired at:").bean(new MyBean(),
         "callDrools('rhel8',6,2048,4096)");
----                

To run the demo:

----
mvn install quarkus:dev
----

Then, invoke the /start endpoint which triggers the Camel direct component:

----
curl http://localhost:8080/start
----

=== Known limitations

* No support for native execution (as of today)

* You need to use a Bean or Processor to handle the execution of Drools Rules. Although there is a Quarkus extension (kogito-quarkus-rules) that natively supports Rules execution, it won't include KJAR packaging artifacts.
