== Quarkus Camel extension demo

This Demo demonstrates how to load a Drools Rule bundled in a KJAR File from within a Camel Route:

----
 from("direct:start").setBody().simple("Hello World Camel fired at:").bean(new MyBean(), "callDrools()");

----                

To run the demo:

* Install the KJAR in the local Maven repository

----
cd basic-kjar

mvn install
----

* Build and run the Quarkus application

----
cd camel-demo

mvn install quarkus:dev

----

Then, invoke the /start endpoint which triggers the Camel direct component:

----
curl http://localhost:8080/start
----

=== Known limitations

* No support for native execution (as of today)

* You need to use a Bean or Processor to handle the execution of Drools Rules. Although there is a Quarkus extension (kogito-quarkus-rules) that natively supports Rules execution, it won't include KJAR packaging artifacts.
